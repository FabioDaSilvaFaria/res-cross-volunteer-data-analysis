# 🧩 Red Cross Volunteer Data Project

Developed by **Fabio Da Silva Faria**, an aspiring Data Analyst transitioning from a successful background in recruitment into the data analytics space.  
This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insight generation using real-world Red Cross volunteer data.

---

This project focuses on analyzing volunteer data for the Red Cross to identify demographic trends, service distribution, and regional engagement patterns.  
The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Excel and Power Query, visualized in Power BI, and summarized through key insights and visual dashboards.

## ⚙️ Data Cleaning (Excel + Power Query)

Initial data cleaning was performed in **Excel** to correct formatting issues and remove duplicates.  
Further transformation was done in **Power Query** to ensure consistency and prepare the dataset for visualization.  

Key transformations included:
- Standardizing column names and data types  
- Replacing inconsistent values  
- Filtering incomplete or inactive records  
- Creating calculated fields (e.g., volunteer tenure)  

Below is a snapshot of the Power Query *Applied Steps* panel:

## 📊 Dashboard Previews

Below are key visuals from the Power BI dashboard created for the Red Cross Volunteer Data Project:

### 1. Sociodemographic Distribution of Volunteers
Shows the gender, age, education and occupation composition of volunteers across all regions.
